MILESTONE 1 (PROJECT OVERVIEW)

API (APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE) :
        An API is a way for different software programs to talk to each other and share information. It defines how one program can request data or services from another program.
        
MERN STACK :
        The MERN stack is a group of technologies used to build full-stack web applications. It includes:
                 1. MongoDB: A NoSQL database to store data.
                 2. Express.js: A web framework for building server-side applications with Node.js.
                 3. React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces (front-end).
                 4. Node.js: A JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side.
        Together, these technologies let you build both the front-end and back-end of a web app using JavaScript.

AUTHENICATION : 
        Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It ensures that someone (or something) is who they claim to be before granting access to a system or application.
            Common methods of authentication include:
                1. Username and Password: The most basic form, where the user provides a username and a secret password.
                2. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): A second layer of security, often involving a code sent to your phone or email, along with the password.      
        In short, authentication is about ensuring only authorized users can access a system.

E-COMMERANCE APPLICATION :
        An e-commerce application is a software platform or website that allows businesses and customers to buy and sell products or services online. It handles tasks like:
                1. Product listings: Displaying items for sale.
                2. Shopping cart: Allowing customers to add and manage items they want to buy.
                3. Payment processing: Enabling secure payments via credit cards, PayPal, etc.
                4. Order management: Tracking orders, shipments, and deliveries.
        Examples of e-commerce applications are websites like Amazon, eBay, and Shopify stores.

BJSON (BINARY JSON) :
      BSON is a version of JSON that stores data in a binary format (not text). Itâ€™s used by MongoDB to save data more efficiently and supports extra data types like images and timestamps. It's faster and more compact than regular JSON.

FULL STACK :
     Full Stack refers to the complete set of technologies used to build both the front-end (the part of a website or app that users see and interact with) and the back-end (the server-side that handles data processing, storage, and logic) of an application.
     A Full Stack Developer is someone who can work on both the front-end and back-end parts of a web application.
     For example, in the MERN stack:
          1. Front-end: React
          2. Back-end: Node.js + Express
          3. Database: MongoDB
A Full Stack developer knows how to build and manage the entire application from start to finish.
